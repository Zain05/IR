    % Reading a 3D image costs a lot to VREP (it has to simulate the image). It also requires a lot of bandwidth, 
    % and processing a 3D point cloud (for instance, to find one of the boxes or cylinders that the robot has to
    % grasp) will take a long time in MATLAB. In general, you will only want to capture a 3D image at specific times, 
    % for instance when you believe you're facing one of the tables.

    % Reduce the view angle to better see the objects. 
    res = vrep.simxSetFloatSignal(id, 'rgbd_sensor_scan_angle', pi / 8, vrep.simx_opmode_oneshot_wait);
    vrchk(vrep, res);

    % Ask the sensor to turn itself on, take A SINGLE 3D IMAGE, and turn itself off again. 
    res = vrep.simxSetIntegerSignal(id, 'handle_xyz_sensor', 1, vrep.simx_opmode_oneshot_wait);
    vrchk(vrep, res);

    % Then use the depth sensor. 
    fprintf('Capturing point cloud...\n');
    pts = youbot_xyz_sensor(vrep, h, vrep.simx_opmode_oneshot_wait);
    % Each column of pts has [x;y;z;distancetosensor]. However, plot3 does not have the same frame of reference as 
    % the output data. To get a correct plot, you should invert the y and z dimensions. 

    % Plot all the points. 
    figure;
    plot3(pts(1, :), pts(2, :), pts(3, :), '*');
    
    % Plot the points of the wall (further away than 1.87 m) in a different colour. 
    hold on; 
    ptsWall = pts(1:3, pts(4, :) >= 1.87);
